This One-time Payment Hub project has 2 modules which are the Admin and Clients. The Admin module is the side of the system in which the business management can manage all the important lists and records in the system such as the list of partner companies and clients' transaction records. The Client Module is the side of the system for the public where can users can register their own account, pay bills, and list their payment transaction records. This system also generates a date-wise printable transaction report at the admin side.
